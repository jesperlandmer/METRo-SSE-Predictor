# METRo-SSE-Predictor

Repository for the bachelor degree thesis project conducted by Jesper Landm√©r Pedersen.

### Data

Data has been extracted from the original `.h5`-file and transformed into a more easily readable format. Data from the winter season is located in the data directory, and data from the spring season is located in the data2 directory.
